# dekhn

dekhn watches nginx logs and your rust service and ships logs / traces to AWS CloudWatch etc

# State

`dekhn` stores its state in a sqlite file. 

`nginx_log`: table contains one row for every log file, log files should be uniquely named, and the position within that file that has already been shipped.

`app_log`: against request-id (generated by nginx), it stores the JSON data. Once data is shipped they are deleted from this table.
